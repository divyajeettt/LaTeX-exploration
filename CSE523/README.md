# CSE523: Randomized Algorithms

## About CSE523

**[CSE523: *Randomized Algorithms*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE523)** is a 5xx-level course offered to CS undergrads at IIIT-Delhi. It introduces the basics of [Randomized Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm) and how randomization serves as a trade-off between the performance and simplicity/accuracy of algorithms.
It aims to enable students to:

- analyze algorithms with respect to probabalistically distributed inputs
- design randomized algorithms for various problems, prove their correctness, and bound their performance
- understand the role of probability in algorithmic problems
