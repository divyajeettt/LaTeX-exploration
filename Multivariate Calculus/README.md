## About MTH203

**[MTH203: *Multivariate Calculus*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=MTH203)** is a 2xx-level course offered to all undergrads at IIIT-Delhi. The course covers basics of [Multivariate Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus), [Vector Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus), and [Complex Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis). It aims to:

- enable students to apply the concepts of limits, differentiation, integration, and finding extrema of multivariable functions
- enable students to work with vector fields, evaluate line and surface integrals, and carry out vector derivate operations
- enable students to evaluate derivatives and integrals of complex functions, and determine their convergent power series
