# MTH203: Multivariate Calculus

## About MTH203

**[MTH203: *Multivariate Calculus*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=MTH203)** is a 2xx-level course offered to all undergrads at IIIT-Delhi. The course covers basics of [Multivariate Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus), [Vector Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus), and [Complex Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis). It aims to:

- enable students to apply the concepts of [limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)), differentiation, integration, and finding [extrema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima) of multivariable functions
- enable students to work with [Vector Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field#:~:text=In%20vector%20calculus%20and%20physics,a%20point%20in%20the%20plane.), evaluate line and surface integrals, and carry out vector derivative operations
- enable students to evaluate derivatives and integrals of complex functions, and determine their [convergent power series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series)
