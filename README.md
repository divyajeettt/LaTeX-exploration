## About LaTeX-exploration

This repository contains some documents that were created to learn the basics of LaTeX. Currently, it hosts four different *projects*:

- Some exams recreated from the original PDFs of the course Linear Algebra
- Some class notes for the course Multivariate Calculus
- Theory Assignments for the course Algorithms under Uncertainty
- Theory Assignments for the course Randomized Algorithms
