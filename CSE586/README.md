# CSE586: Algorithms under Uncertainty

## About CSE586

**[CSE586: *Algorithms under Uncertainty*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE586)** is a 5xx-level course offered to CS undergrads at IIIT-Delhi. It introduces the basics of [Online Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm) and the notion of uncertainty in the input to algorithms.
It aims to enable students to:

- design algorithms for discrete online setting and analyze them using [Competitve Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_analysis_(online_algorithm)#:~:text=Unlike%20traditional%20worst%2Dcase%20analysis,of%20the%20optimal%20offline%20algorithm.), [Potential Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_method), and other modern algorithmic techniques
- utilize techniques like [Yao's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_principle) to prove lower bounds on the performance of randomized online algorithms
- design and analyze problems for [Online Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning) through classical frameworks like [Online Gradient Descent](https://parameterfree.com/2019/09/11/online-gradient-descent/), [Multiplicative Weight Update (MWU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_weight_update_method#:~:text=The%20multiplicative%20weights%20update%20method,game%20theory%20and%20algorithm%20design.), etc.
