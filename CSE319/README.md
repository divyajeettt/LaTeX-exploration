# CSE319: Modern Algorithm Design

## About CS319

**[CSE319: *Modern Algorithm Design*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE319)** is a 3xx-level course offered to CS undergrads at IIIT-Delhi. It introduces the advanced methods of algorithm design to students, covering various fields.
It aims to enable students to:

- design algorithms for discrete settings and understand applications of algorithms of different natures
- use techniques like [Randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm), [Approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm), [Duality in Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_linear_program), etc. to design efficient algorithms and heuristics
- use advanced data structures to solve problems efficiently and analyze their time and space complexity using different techniques such as [Amortized Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis), [Potential Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_method), etc.
